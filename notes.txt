FIREWALL

	If you are working with firewalls, you will need to open the appropriate ports for
	communication and testing:
	•
	•
	TCP/861
	UDP/ephemeral
	(Control communication)
	(Settable using testports configuration in owampd.conf)
	To do this using iptables, the additional arguments would look something like:
	-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport
	861 -j ACCEPT
	-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p udp -j ACCEPT

Limits
	
	Limit profiles should be changed in owampd.limits
