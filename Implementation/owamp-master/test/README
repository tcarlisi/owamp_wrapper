This directory holds owamp unit tests:

owtvec:  This application uses the AES based Exponential
         Deviates functions from the owamp library and
         verifies the implementation successfully produces
         the expected results from Appendix B of the OWAMP
         specification.

owstats: read a reference session message and verify it can
         be parsed and statistics can be generated

         and then returns appropriate responses

owe2e_clear:
owe2e_auth:
owe2e_enc:
         launch owping/owampd child processes and capture
         the test output - verify there were no errors

twping_clear:
twping_enc:
         use the twamp client protocol api to generate and send
         messages to a simiulated server, which validates them
         and then returns appropriate responses

twe2e_clear:
twe2e_auth:
twe2e_enc:
         launch twping/twampd child processes and capture
         the test output - verify there were no errors
