Currently owamp has only been tested on FreeBSD - specifically versions 4.6
and 4.7.

The owamp software uses the "autoconf" tools to prepare a build process. It is
distributed with a pre-built "configure" script - so the "autoconf" tools should
not be needed. (gnumake may be required... I have not tried using other versions
of make.)

The simple build procedure would be:

	% gzip -cd owamp-$VERS.tar.gz | tar xf -
	% cd owamp-$VERS
	% ./configure --prefix=/inst/root
	% make
	% make install
then
	* edit owamp-$VERS/conf/owampd.conf (modify datadir!)
	* copy owampd.conf to a config directory. (/inst/root/etc?)

There is currently no build process to help build the owampd configuration
file - or to build "init.d" scripts. There are some example configuration
files in the $owamp/conf directory - I highly recommend you edit them
before using them.

To run the daemon:

	% owampd -c /path/to/confdir (/inst/root/etc in above)

The daemon will run without an owampd configuration file if you use enough
of the command-line flags - but it is much easier to use the config file.
There is an example configuration file in $owampd/conf/owampd.conf (in the
alpha release, this is the only config file used - ignore the others for now).
The most important parameter to set is the "datadir". One-way tests "toward"
owampd will not work if this is not set to a directory writable by the owampd
process.

To get the list of available options use:

	% owampd -h


To run the client:

	% owping host.running.owampd

This will run two one-way tests. One toward the named host, and one from. These
two tests will happen immediately and concurrently. (The default average
interval is 100 msec's and the default test length is 100 packets - so this test
will take around 10 seconds.)

To get the list of available options use:

	% owping -h


To setup local authentication, create an owamp-server.pfs file using the
pfstore I2util command.  For more information see the owamp-server.pfs(5)
man page:

	% pfstore -f owamp-server.pfs -n [username]
