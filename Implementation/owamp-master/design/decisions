1. (Server) Develop as a standalone server
        A. Standalone
                not all systems run inetd
                easier to debug
		only reasonible way to apply system-wide resource limits

2. Send/Recieve roles should be separate processes from client/server
        A. select of single file descriptor - perhaps more accurate time
        B. localize clock mgmt to send/recv code/process
	C. Able to use same send/recv code in client and server

3. Concurrent server model
	use traditional accept/fork/exec
		resource limits applied using controlling parent process
		(Threads not portable enough yet... grr.)
		(pre-forking not worth it - few long-lived connections)
		(async i/o - not worth the complexity.)
