This document outlines the main usage scenerios or applications we envision
using the owamp control protocol.

1. one-way ping
	description:
	User is curious about the current datarate. Wants to quickly see what
	is currently happening between his host and another.

	assumptions:
	typically unauthenticated mode
	short sessions/low data rates
	application is executing at either the sender or reciever host

2. extended test session
	description:
	User wants to diagnose a problematic link. Runs a session over
	that link to quantify what is happening.

	assumptions: prior agreement (key exchange setup)
	authenticated transaction
	either long time duration, or somewhat higher datarates
	application is usually executing at either the sender or reciever host
		(if not, then the sender or reciever is configuring the
		other endpoint on behalf of the client.)

3. production monitoring system
	description:
	Centralized monitoring system is collecting one-way measurements
	from a great number of hosts. It is setup to do simple analysis
	on the results, and notifies the administrator if results are greatly
	different then expected.

	assumptions:
	prior agreement (key exchange setup)
	authenticated transaction
	very long time duration - low data rates
	central monitor contacts owamp servers(recv) and has them contact
		open beacon owamp servers(send).
	The monitor collects data from the owamp server(recv) periodically
		during the sessions.

4. destructive tests of network links
	description:
	network admin wants to see what a link is capable of.

	assumptions:
	prior agreement
	control is probably on a non-standard port
	long time duration/high bandwidth
	recv side probably can't save data - runs processing on the fly
		to compute pre decided values
