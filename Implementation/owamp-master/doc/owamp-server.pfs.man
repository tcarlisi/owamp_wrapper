.SH NAME
owamp-server.pfs \- One-way latency server pass-phrase store
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBowamp-server.pfs\fR file (owamp-server.pfs by default) is used to hold the
identity/pass-phrase pairs needed for \fBowampd\fR to authenticate users.
The format of this file is described in the pfstore(1) manual page. The
location of this file is controlled by the \fB\-c\fR option to \fBowampd\fR.
.PP
\fBowampd\fR uses symmetric AES keys for authentication. These keys
are derived from a shared secret (the pass-phrase) using the PBKDF2
algorithm (\fBRFC 2898\fR) with an HMAC-SHA1 as the pseudorandom
function.
.PP
Therefore, the
\fBowping\fR client must have access to the exact same pass-phrase
that the \fBowampd\fR server uses. Both the client and the server
need to derive the same AES key for authentication
to work.  It is important that the system administrator and end user
ensure the pass-phrase is not compromised.
.PP
If the \fBowping\fR client is able to authenticate using the identity and
derived AES key, \fBowampd\fR will use the directives found in the
\fBowamp-server.limits\fR file to map policy restrictions for this connection.
.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
The pass-phrases in the \fBowamp-server.pfs\fR file are not encrypted in any way.
(They are simply hex encoded.) The
security of these pass-phrases are completely dependent upon the security
of the filesystem and the discretion of the system administrator.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
\fBIdentity\fR names are restricted to 80 characters.
