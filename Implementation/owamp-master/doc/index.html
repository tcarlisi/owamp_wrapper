OWAMP Version 3.4rc3 </h1></center>

<center>(An implementation of the <b>O</b>ne-<b>W</b>ay <b>A</b>ctive <b>M</b>easurement
<b>P</b>rotocol)
<br><a href="http://e2epi.internet2.edu/owamp/">http://e2epi.internet2.edu/owamp/</a></center>

<b>OWAMP</b> is a command line client application and a policy daemon used
to determine one way latencies between hosts. It is an implementation of
the <b><i>OWAMP</i></b> protocol as defined by
<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4656.txt">http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4656.txt</a>.
(When referring to the protocol within this document, "<i>OWAMP</i>" will
be in italicized. In all other instances, "OWAMP" will be referring to
this implementation.)
<p>With roundtrip-based measurements, it is hard to isolate the direction
in which congestion is experienced. One-way measurements solve this problem
and make the direction of congestion immediately apparent. Since traffic
can be asymmetric at many sites that are primarily producers or consumers
of data, this allows for more informative measurements. One-way measurements
allow the user to better isolate the effects of specific parts of a network
on the treatment of traffic.
<p>With the One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (<i>OWAMP</i>) available,
network providers will be able to better know the exact behavior of their
networks and apply resources where improvement is most likely. (Note: Passive
observation of average link use misses the transient queues – active measurement
could see them.) Users would be more informed about network performance.
This would prompt a better allocation of resources by network providers,
decreasing areas of congestion where possible.
<p>The increasing availability of precise time sources allows network hosts
to timestamp packets with typical errors that are substantially smaller
than the delays seen on real non-LAN networks. This makes it possible for
one-way measurements to be collected across a broad mesh of network paths.
In addition, the open source nature of OWAMP makes it possible for one-way
metrics to become as common as are round-trip metrics (from tools like
<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><font size=-1>ping</font></font>).
<p>The <i>OWAMP</i> protocol also simplifies the analysis of measurement
results – explicit send and receive timestamps for every measurement packet
make analysis more straightforward because one does not need to assume
return path reliability, preservation of inter-packet spacing by the round-trip
measurement reflector, etc. For example, packet reordering, which can have
implications for TCP performance, can be measured under a variety of input
scenarios, with separation of reordering on the forward and return paths.
<p><i>OWAMP</i> session control uses traditional client-server communication
between a control-client and a server, using the <i>OWAMP-Control</i> protocol.
The <b>owampd</b> server is implemented using the conventional accept/fork
model. The two sides negotiate one-way test parameters using the
<i>OWAMP-Control</i>
protocol. This OWAMP implementation then forks additional processes to
actually send and receive the <i>OWAMP-Test</i> formatted packets that
implement the session endpoints for the Sender and Receiver roles.
<p>Using <i>OWAMP</i>, it is possible to collect active measurement data
sufficient to determine a broad class of singleton characteristics (e.g.,
loss probability, median delay, jitter, 90th percentile of delay). Non-singleton
characteristics, such as the expected inter-arrival gap of packets that
were sent back-to-back, can be measured as well. Note: All measurements
are done with synthetic traffic; application simulation is outside of the
scope of <i>OWAMP</i>. The protocol is not designed to be able to send
a packet as soon as a response to the previous packet arrives, but can
send on any predetermined schedule (including immediately after the last
packet was sent).
<p>OWAMP has been designed to be deployable on as many systems as possible.
Just as it is possible to <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><font size=-1>ping</font></font>
most hosts on the network today, widespread deployment of OWAMP would make
it possible to conduct more accurate measurement sessions.
<p>The OWAMP development team recognizes that network measurement systems
become more unwieldy as their size grows. When a full-mesh measurement
architecture is used, the amount of disk space and network capacity used
by the system will grow as the square of the number of measurement nodes.
While nothing can be done to alleviate this problem, OWAMP was designed
not to introduce any <i>new</i> scalability problems. It allows the user
to conduct only those measurement sessions desired, and to retain as much
(or as little) data as desired. OWAMP also does not dictate a choice of
site(s) where measurement results are stored: it is possible to have all
data stored at a central site or to store data at each receiver and fetch
it as needed.
<p>The <b>owping</b> client is used to request a measurement session. The
<b>owping</b>
parameters allow the user to select the send schedule, direction of the
test (and peer), as well as the packet size. The <b>owping</b> application
contacts an <b>owampd</b> process on the peer system to request the specific
one-way measurement session. <b>owampd</b> is responsible for implementing
the policy restrictions imposed by the system administrator on that system.
A more detailed description of the OWAMP architecture is available on the
<a href="details.html">details
page</a>.
<p><b>owampd</b> allows a system administrator to configure any given host
as an <i>OWAMP</i> test endpoint. Specific policy limits can be applied
to specific users, and individual tests are coordinated so they will not
interfere with each other. <i>OWAMP</i> allows the administrator to classify
incoming connections based upon a user name and AES key (generated by a
pass phrase) combination or, alternatively, based upon an IP/netmask. Once
the connection is classified, the <b>owampd</b> can determine the exact
test parameters that will be allowed. (More details on the policy controls
can be found in the
<a href="owamp-server.limits.man.html">owamp-server.limits(8)</a>
manual page.)
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Full IPv6 support. No options needed. If the target of a test is specified
by a DNS hostname, and that name has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address defined,
the <b>owping</b> command line application prefers the IPv6 address.</li>

<li>
Configurable send schedule and packet sizes as requested by the client.</li>

<li>
Resource protection as defined by the policy controls implemented in <b>owampd</b>.</li>
<li>
Port range specification for packet receivers for firewall friendliness.
</li>
<li>
Wide range of statistical output formats and information.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
OWAMP prefers a synchronized clock for measurements to be meaningful.
But, more importantly, the clock needs to be stable. If the system clock
is stepped during an OWAMP session, the results can be misleading.
</p>
<p>OWAMP
prefers that NTP (ntpd) be running to synchronize the system clock. NTP must
be setup correctly on the system for NTP to calculate a reasonable estimate
of the time error and for it to stabilize the clock. NTP<b> <font color="#FF0000">MUST</font></b><font color="#000000">
be configured with no fewer than 4 clocks for this purpose. (See <a href="details.html#NTP">details.html</a>
for more specific information on configuring NTP.)</font>
Some measurements will still be meaningful if the clocks are not synchronized.
For example, jitter measurements are still valid.
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting that <i>OWAMP</i> should be run on real hardware.
Virtualization packages such as vmware, xen, linux "kvm", parallels will
exhibit clock instability that will make most <i>OWAMP</i> measurements
chaotic.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, it possible power-management features of most PC hardware
should be disabled. (Speeding up and slowing down the processor makes for
a very instable clock.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<i>OWAMP</i> uses NTP-specific system calls to fetch time
and time error estimates from the system kernel if they are available.
It will report the time as unsynchronized if it is unable to access the
NTP information this way. (It is still possible that the system clock
is synchronized, <i>OWAMP</i> is just unable to verify that.
</li>

<li>
<b>gnumake</b> may be required for the build process (see
<a href="#Build">Building
the Application</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Supported Systems</h3>
OWAMP has been tested on the following:
<blockquote>
<dl>
    <dt>FreeBSD</dt>
    <dd>5.4</dd>
    <dd>6.1</dd>
    <dt>Linux</dt>
    <dd>2.6.9</dd>
    <dt>MacOS X</dt>
    <dd>10.4.8</dd>
    <dt>Solaris</dt>
    <dd>5.10</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
OWAMP has a fairly resilient set of autoconf tests incorporated into
the build process. Most recent versions of UNIX should work.
<h3> <hr WIDTH="100%">Version Compatibility</h3>
The <b>OWAMP</b> specification has gone through several revisions since
its inception. Therefore, the OWAMP software has needed to track different
versions of the protocol as it has evolved. To determine which versions
are compatible, look at the major version number. Whenever the application
has moved to a new incompatible version of the protocol the major version
number has changed. For example, version 1.6f is <b>NOT</b> compatible
with version 2.0c, and those two versions are also <b>NOT</b> compatible with
any version 3 implementation. (Version 3 is the first version that is
actually compatible with RFC 4656.)
<h3> <hr WIDTH="100%">Recommended Hardware</h3>
OWAMP does not have any strict hardware requirements. More tasking packet
send schedules will of course require more capable hardware but low bandwidth
schedules with small packets can be done on fairly modest hardware. In
general, the more head room your system has, the more accurate your timestamps
will be. <b>Internet2</b> has had good luck using the following hardware
to collect data on the <b>Abilene</b> network:
<dl>
<dd>
Intel SCB2 motherboard</dd>
<dd>
Inter Ethernet Pro 10/100+ (i82555) (on-motherboard)</dd>
<dd>
2 x 1.266 GHz PIII, 512 KB L2 cache, 133 MHz FSB</dd>
<dd>
2 x 512 MB ECC registered RAM (one/slot to enable interleaving)</dd>
<dd>
2 x Seagate 18 GB SCSI (ST318406LC)</dd>
</dl>
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="Build"></a>Building the Application</h3>
The OWAMP software uses the <i>gnu autoconf</i> tools to configure the
build process. OWAMP is distributed with a pre-built <b>configure</b> script
so the actual <i>autoconf</i> tools should not be needed on the target
system. (Although, <b>gnumake</b> may be required...) The
<b>configure</b>
script can be run with the <i>--help</i> option to determine the full set
of configurable options.
<p>A basic build procedure would be:
<blockquote>
<pre>% gzip -cd owamp-$VERS.tar.gz | tar xf -
% cd owamp-$VERS
&nbsp; # --prefix is only needed if you don't like the default
&nbsp; #&nbsp;&nbsp; (/usr/local on most systems)
% ./configure --prefix=/inst/root
% make
% make install</pre>
</blockquote>
Please report any build problems to <a href="mailto:owamp-users@internet2.edu">owamp-users@internet2.edu</a>.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Configuring owampd</h3>
The basic procedure to configure <b>owampd</b> is to create an
<a href="owamp-server.conf.man.html">owamp-server.conf</a>
and, optionally, an <a href="owamp-server.limits.man.html">owamp-server.limits</a>
file and an
<a href="owamp-server.pfs.man.html">owamp-server.pfs</a> file. These
files need to be installed in the same directory that is specified with
the <b>-c</b> option to <b>owampd</b>. The recommended directory is
<i>/inst/root/etc</i>.
(The <i>etc</i> directory below your install root.) There are examples
of these files in the <i>owamp-$VERS/conf&nbsp;</i> subdirectory of the
distribution.
<p><b>owamp-server.conf:</b>
<br>Used to configure basic operation of the daemon, such as server listening
port and error logging. For a detailed description of the options available,
see the <a href="owamp-server.conf.man.html">owamp-server.conf(8)</a> manual page.
<p><b>owamp-server.limits:</b>
<br>Used to configure the policy limits for the daemon. There are two parts
to this policy: 1) authentication and 2) authorization. The authentication
is done by assigning a class to each new connection. Each class has a set
of limits associated with it. The classes are hierarchical, so a connection
must pass the limit restrictions of the assigned class as well as all parent
classes. For a detailed description of the options available, see the
<a href="owamp-server.limits.man.html">owamp-server.limits(5)</a>
manual page.
<p><b>owamp-server.pfs:</b>
<br>Used to associate identities with pass-phrases (shared secrets).
These identities are then
mapped to a class by the <b>owamp-server.limits</b> file. For a more detailed
description, see the <a href="owamp-server.pfs.man.html">owamp-server.pfs(5)</a>
manual page.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Running <i>owampd</i></h3>
The normal command-line to start the daemon is:
<blockquote>
<pre>&nbsp;% owampd -c /inst/root/etc</pre>
</blockquote>
It is possible to run the daemon without a config file directory if enough
command line options are specified, but it is easier to use a config file.
<p>To see all the available options:
<blockquote>
<pre>&nbsp;% owampd -h</pre>
</blockquote>
More details on running the daemon, as well as a complete description of
the command line options, are available from the <a href="owampd.man.html">owampd(8)</a>
manual page.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Running <i>owping</i></h3>
The basic command line for the client is:
<blockquote>
<pre>% owping [options] targethost</pre>
</blockquote>
This will run a 10-second session in each direction, concurrently at a
rate of 10 packets per second.
<p>To see a list of available options:
<blockquote>
<pre>% owping -h</pre>
</blockquote>
More details on running the client application, with a complete description
of all command-line options, are available from the <a href="owping.man.html">owping(1)</a>
manual page.
