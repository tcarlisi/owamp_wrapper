	owamp

This release is an implementation of the OWAMP (one-way active measurement
protocol) defined by
 http://www.internet2.edu/~shalunov/ippm/draft-ietf-ippm-owdp-14.txt.

It is organized as follows:

I2util/		convienient utility functions... Error reporting, hash funcs...
owamp/		directory for owamp api - a high level abstraction for
		speaking the owamp protocol.
owampd/		An owamp server implementation.
owping/		A command line owamp client (one way ping).
powstream/	A client-daemon for continuous one-way tests.
                (This is a one-off application that Internet2
                uses to run continuous tests on a mesh of Abilene
                measurement hosts. There is currently no documentation
                and only limited support for this tool. If it interests
                you, please say so and it may get better support in the
                future.)
conf/           Example config files. (not installed - EXAMPLES!)
doc/            html and man page descriptions of owamp tools.
test/           validate programs.
