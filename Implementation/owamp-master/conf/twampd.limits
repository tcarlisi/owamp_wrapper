#	This file is used to define policy for the twampd process. There
#	are two parts to this policy. 1) authentication. 2) authorization.
#	The authentication is done by assigning a "user class" to each
#	new connection as it comes in. Each "user class" has a set
#	of limits associated with it. The "user classes" are hierarchical, so
#	a connection must pass the limit restrictions of the given
#	"user class" as well as all "parent" classes.
#
#	Within this file "assign" lines are used to assign a "user class"
#	to a given connection. "limit" lines are used to define a "user class"
#	and set the limits associated with that "user class". You can not
#	use a classname before it is defined using a limit line.
#
#	The format of this file is as follows:
#		1) Comment lines are any line that the first non-whitespace
#		charactor is '#'. These lines are completely ignored other
#		than being counted so error messages can give reasonable
#		line numbers.
#
#		2) Lines may be continued by using the semi-standard '\'
#		charactor followed immediately by the newline. This is the
#		only valid place for the '\' charactor, and if it is found
#		anywhere else it is a syntax error.
#
#		3) blank lines are treated as comment lines.
#
#		4) All other lines much conform to the syntax of a "limit"
#		line or an "assign" line.
#
#	"limit" lines:
#
#		These are used to define the "user class" hierarchy. They
#		define a classname as well as the limits associated with
#		that class. Classnames may only be defined once. The
#		format of these lines are:
#
#		limit $classname with $key=$value[,$key=$value]*
#		
#		$classname defines the name of the class with the given
#		limits. (whitespace is used as a separator but is otherwise
#		ignored. Add as much as you want to make the file more
#		readable.) $classname is used as a directory name component
#		so care should be taken not to use charactors that would not
#		be advisable in a directory name. (i.e. '/' would be
#		inadvisible.)
#
#		The currently valid values for $key are:
#			key		value-type			def
#			--------------------------------------------------------
#			parent		previously defined $classname	null
#			bandwidth	integer bits/s			0
#			disk		integer bytes			0
#			delete_on_fetch	on/off				off
#			allow_open_mode	on/off				on
#			test_sessions	integer sessions	0
#
#		parent:
#			The first "limit" line cannot have a parent since
#			none have been defined yet. As such, the first
#			line defines the root of your class hierarchy.
#			All remaining limit lines MUST assign a parent.
#			(This is hierarchical after all.)
#
#		bandwidth:
#			This limits the estimated amount of bandwidth that
#			can be consumed by all connections of the given
#			class. 0 indicates unlimited by policy, but remember
#			this is checked all the way to the root of the
#			hierarchy. (If you want an unlimited class, your
#			root must be unlimited, and the whole path down
#			to the given class.)
#			(default: 0 - no limit)
#
#		disk:
#			This limits the amount of diskspace that can be
#			consumed be each class. The files are stored in
#			a hierarchical directory structure (surprise, surprise)
#			that mirrors the class hierarchy. The disk limit
#			has a soft/hard component to it. When a test is
#			requested, the soft limit is used to determine
#			if the test should be allowed. However, because
#			of the possibility of duplicate packets, the file
#			could end up being larger than that estimate. If
#			that happens - the limit set by this $key will be
#			multiplied by the "diskfudge" factor before being
#			compared with the usage. If the file size is still
#			larger than the limit*"diskfudge", then the file
#			will be unlinked immediately. (Therefore, if your
#			tests are likely to measure a larger amount of
#			duplicates, I recommend using larger values
#			for "diskfudge". (diskfudge is a float value between
#			1.0 and 10.0 - it defaults to 1.0.)
#			(default: 0 - no limit)
#
#		delete_on_fetch:
#			This limit is really more of a behavior option. It
#			is used to mark session files such that they are
#			deleted immediately after being fetched.
#			(default: off)
#
#		allow_open_mode:
#			This limit is only useful if the class is assigned
#			to a netmask. It is used to limit specific netmasks
#			to only encrypted or authenticated mode transactions.
#			(default: on)
#
#		test_sessions:
#			This limits the number of test sessions that can be
#			requested per control session. 0 indicates unlimited by
#			policy, but remember this is checked all the way to the
#			root of the hierarchy. (If you want an unlimited class,
#			your root must be unlimited, and the whole path down to
#			the given class.)
#			(default: 0 - no limit)
#	
#	"assign" lines:
#		These are used to assign a "user class" to the connection.
#		The format is:
#
#		assign $assigntype [targs*] $classname
#
#		$assigntype defines the type of assignment. There are currently
#		three types of assignment:
#			default,user,net
#
#		"default" is used if no other assignment matches. It takes no
#		additional args:
#
#		assign default jail
#
#		This would assign any connection that didn't match more closely
#		to the classname jail.
#
#		"user" is used to match the "username" specified in the twamp
#		protocol with a "user class". The "username" within the
#		protocol is used as a key to fetch the "shared secret". The
#		format of this line would be:
#
#		assign user joe paradise
#
#		This would assign a connection that was able to authenticate
#		using the "username" joe the limits specified for the classname
#		paradise.

# setup the root node with unlimited disk and bandwidth
limit root with disk=0,\
		bandwidth=0,\
                delete_on_fetch=on

# Limit non-authorized users to 10G of disk storage, and 1M of bandwidth
# (overall for all non-authorized users). Unspecified values default to
# parent permissions
limit regular with parent=root,\
		disk=10G,\
		bandwidth=20M

# Default everything to regular user access
assign default regular
