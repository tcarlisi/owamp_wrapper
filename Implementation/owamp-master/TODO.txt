Check datadir is writable on startup: fail if not
Modify to treat I2util as independent package
Fix version string in help message (Now reports I2util version)
Document missing packet format for -R output
Powstream: Add -D option
Add 'make check' tests to owamp
test all owamp client apps
Port owamp 3.0a to FreeBSD
Add crypto NOTES
version option
Copyright/License in distribution
owamp: memory debug check
owamp: methodological errors included in timestamp?
Add version flag (not -h)
have owup report server version
Autoconf: Update AC_CHECK_HEADERS (see bwctl)
Test DSCP (-D) - tcpdump to view diffserv bits
powstream: Modify -i to do full schedule (like owping)
owampd: add delete_on_cntrl_close option
Modify AcceptType values to new spec terms
owampd: full disk problem not clear
powstream -h: Add defaults into output
ContextCreate - varargs (see bwctl)
Document SIGNALS for owampd/owping (powstream?)
ContextCreate var for no NTP sync warnings

---------------------------------

owampd: owampd.limits - add a more compact way of assigning a whole list of users to a group(user class)
owampd: owampd.limits file - add limit option for "reject=on"
owampd: NTP sanity check - check N peers, etc...

OWAMP Paper

Review 1:
        + Additional Calibration tests on other architectures
        * Show that unaccounted for errors are not accountable AND
                show that they are insignificant.
        * Data from more "generic" end systems. (not on abilene, no GPS)
        * Better motivation explaination.
        * What does quiescent mean? "one of the tests?"
        * Discuss the effects of "caching".
        * Discuss/measure ICMP processing time.
        * More references on NTP precision.
        * Fix figure/table references.
        * Explain Labels/captions for plot axis.
        * Make Fig 2 (context switches) less confusing.

Review 2:
        * Discuss deployment issues. (feasibility of wide acceptance)
        * Possibility/performance of porting to major router vendor product.
        * More detailed discussion of the OWAMP implementation.
Review 3:
        * Rewrite fully.
        * Add roles picture for Section II(Protocol design)
        * Fix figure/table refs. (III-B-1 vs 2)
        * Add NTP error references.

ACM SIGMETRICS, A, Marina Del Rey, LA, June 2002
        * Apply owamp to unstable path.
